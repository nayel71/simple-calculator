# A Simple Calculator

## Installation

Download/clone the repository, open it in terminal and run `make`.

## Usage

After installation, run `./calc "[expr]"`, where `[expr]` is any (valid) expression involving numbers, spaces, parentheses, `+`, `-` and `*`.

#### Note

`[expr]` is evaluated from left to right. So, for example, multiplication has no preference over addition. Use parentheses to impose orders.
